# CARS

# Gradient Boosting Model: Predicting Car Price
 #Problem Statement
# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the price of cars based on key features. This model leverages the relationship between the car price and specific car attributes like engine size, mileage, and the number of owners to make predictions.

# Goal
The goal of the model is to predict the price of a car by taking input values for features such as engine size, mileage, and owner count. The model will be used for forecasting and gaining insights into car pricing patterns.

 # Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains comprehensive data on car prices for vehicles produced between 2000 and 2023. The key features used to predict car prices are:
•	Engine Size: The size of the car's engine (in liters).
•	Mileage: The total distance the car has traveled, typically measured in kilometers or miles.
•	Owner Count: The number of previous owners of the car.
The target variable for the model is the Price, which is the price of the car.

# Model Training
Import Statements and Dataset
The necessary libraries and modules are imported, and the dataset is loaded into the model. The following Python libraries are used:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
import pickle
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# Data Splitting
The dataset is split into features (independent variables) and the target variable (price). The features considered for this model are Engine_Size, Mileage, and Owner_Count.
•	X (Features): Engine_Size, Mileage, Owner_Count
•	y (Target): Price
The data is split into training and testing sets using an 80%/20% ratio:
python

X = data[['Engine_Size', 'Mileage', 'Owner_Count']]
y = data['Price']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
________________________________________
# Model Training
The Gradient Boosting Regressor model is trained on the training set (X_train, y_train) and predictions are made on both the training and testing sets:
python

# Initialize the Gradient Boosting Regressor model
model_gb = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model on the training data
model_gb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on training and test sets
model_train_pred = model_gb.predict(X_train)
model_test_pred = model_gb.predict(X_test)

# Model Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric, which measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
# Baseline Model Evaluation

A baseline model is created, which predicts the average price for all data points. The MAE for the baseline model is:
•	Baseline Model MAE: 2468.876

# Model Evaluation on Training and Testing Sets
The MAE for the Gradient Boosting model on the training and test sets is calculated as follows:
•	Model (Train) MAE: 1899.785 (Performance on the training data)
•	Model (Test) MAE: 1964.188 (Performance on unseen test data)
The test MAE of 1964.188 indicates that the model performs better than the baseline model (MAE of 2468.876), suggesting that the gradient boosting model has successfully captured the relationship between car features and their prices.

# Calculate the MAE for training and testing sets
train_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_train, model_train_pred)
test_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, model_test_pred)

# Print the results
print(f"The baseline MAE is:\t\t {round(baseline_mae, 3)}")
print(f"The model (train) MAE is:\t {round(train_mae, 3)}")
print(f"The model (test) MAE is:\t {round(test_mae, 3)}")

# Conclusion
The Gradient Boosting model has shown a significant improvement in predictive accuracy over the baseline model, with the test MAE being much lower than the baseline. Specifically, the test MAE of 1964.188 indicates that the model is able to make reasonably accurate predictions about car prices based on features such as engine size, mileage, and owner count.

# Next Steps for Improvement
•	Feature Expansion: Including additional features such as car brand, year of manufacture, fuel type, or condition of the vehicle could further improve model performance.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters (e.g., number of estimators, learning rate) through techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV could lead to better results.
•	Advanced Models: Exploring more complex models like XGBoost, LightGBM, or Deep Learning for even better accuracy.

# Future Work
Future enhancements could focus on:
•	Incorporating additional features such as car design, technology, fuel efficiency, etc., to improve predictive power.
•	Exploring different forecasting techniques or time-series models if the goal is to predict car prices over time.
•	Experimenting with other advanced machine learning models like Polynomial Regression or Neural Networks for further improvements in prediction accuracy.
The model can also be tested on additional datasets to verify its generalizability and robustness in various contexts.

# Notes for Future Enhancement:
•	Feature Scaling: It may be beneficial to scale numerical features like Engine_Size and Mileage for better model performance.
•	Model Interpretability: Using techniques such as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) can help understand which features contribute most to the price prediction.
